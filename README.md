# SENTIMENT-ANALSIS
The proposed sentiment analysis model is designed to automatically classify customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the model preprocesses text data by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, tokenizing, and eliminating stopwords. Using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer, the preprocessed text is transformed into numerical feature vectors. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is then trained on these vectors to learn the patterns associated with each sentiment class. The model is evaluated on both validation and test datasets to ensure its accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the model includes a function to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text inputs, enabling real-time sentiment analysis. This approach provides businesses with an efficient and reliable tool to understand customer opinions, helping them to make data-driven decisions and improve their products and services.
